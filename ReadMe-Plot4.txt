This Plot4 program is also fairly simple:
First the data is read in, then both the time and date as characters are changed into objects. Next, I initiate a 4 2x2 composite plot for all 4 graphs. The basic plot function is called for each of the 4 plots, and finally a .png image file is created for the composite plots.
